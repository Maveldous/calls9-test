# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
   parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
   },
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list

COVER NOTE

1. How you have approached the problem?
   To solve this problem I decide to use basic lightweight stack of technologies as problem not needed many extensibility relate to current requirements. First, I check the whole task and filter most important things that I need to concentrate my attention while writing code. It was: Responsive design, fetch mechanism and unit tests. Then I choose technology and start my work.
2. The technology you have used.
   I prefer to use react framework as universal solution for small-to-large projects and also it was requested in doc. Tailwind css was picked because it can save time on small projects and it can be really useful if you work without proper design system. For fetch data I write small interlayer to native fetch as it can be easily replaced in the future, also such approach called Inversion of control. And finally I prefer to use react query as cache mechanism, hooks and many other useful features to reduce amount of code and create space for future updates.
3. The interactive features of the page.
   Project contains not many features, it have mobile menu and ability to pick a story from list. Then user can write comments to that story and send to provider.
4. Imagine you are writing a cover note to a client explaining what you have done. The note should be no longer than 500 words and should be written in a professional manner in clear and concise English.
